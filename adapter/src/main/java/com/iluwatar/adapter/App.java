package com.iluwatar.adapter;

/**
 * An adapter helps two incompatible interfaces to work together. This is the real world definition
 * for an adapter. Interfaces may be incompatible but the inner functionality should suit the need.
 * The Adapter design pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting
 * the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are two variations of the Adapter pattern: The class adapter implements the adaptee's
 * interface whereas the object adapter uses composition to contain the adaptee in the adapter
 * object.
 *
 * The story of this implementation is this: <br>
 * Pirates are coming! Our captain of the  {@link RealBattleShip} needs help. There are two captains of {@link FishingBoat}s close to with their boats.
 * We need their help but have no time to make up two new {@link BattleShip}s! we need to reuse their {@link FishingBoat}s. The two fisherboat
 * captains need a battleship which can fire and move. The spec is in {@link BattleShip}. We will
 * use the Adapter pattern to reuse the {@link FishingBoat}s.
